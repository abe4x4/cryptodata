#h1 Cryptodata

Starting a graduation project for Code louisville May 22 class (Data Analysis-2). The project will include the following features hoping to meet or exede the requirement of a passing graduation project:

1. Read TWO data sets in with an API or Impoirt and combine 2 csv files
2. Clean data and perform a pandas merge
3. Make a Tableau dashboard to display data
4. Utilize a virtual environment
   
Those features may change or get adjusted in the futre as the project progresses, I will make sure to mention the changes if any in this readme file

I had the general idea of the project in my mind but working on the project itself was delayed due to unusual heavy work load. I decided to document the progress 
of the project in a chronological steps::

 * 07-24-22 
1. Reviewed some youtube virtual environment videos and I was able to create the virtual enviroment of the project
2. Created gitignore folder using github python template
