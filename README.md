<h1>CRYPTODATA</>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

I am a student blockchain developer, I am hoping to graduate next spring. My plan is to make this Code Louisville graduation project the first step towards a much bigger work in progress project of extensive analysis and prediction of the preformance of different cryptocurrencies. I chose to make the project include more than jupyter notebook file, each file is relatively small and covers one feature of the future comprehensive project

The project will include the following features hoping to meet or exeed the requirements of a passing graduation project:

<h4>1. LOADING DATA </h4>
Read 2 dataset with an API.
The first API is forex-python (https://pypi.org/project/forex-python/) where I get bitcoin data, the second API is yfinance API (https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
 
<h4>2. CLEANING DATA</h4> 
Cleaning data and perform a pandas merge

<h4>3. VISUALIZE / PRESENT DATA</h4>
Make 3 matplotlib, pandas and seaborn visualizations to display data

<h4>4. UTILIZE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</h4>
I used the following code to create and use a virutal environment: <br>

<blockquote>
<code><br>
#create environment named venv<br>
python -m venv venv

#activate environment
venv\scripts\activate

install project packages and dependencies

#create a requirements.txt file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

#deactivate environment each time after working on the project
deactivate
 
</code>
</blockquote>

   
Those features may change or get adjusted in the future as the project progresses, I will make sure to mention the changes if any in this readme file

I had the general idea of the project in my mind but working on the project itself was delayed due to unusual heavy work load. I decided to document the progress 
of the project in a chronological steps::

 * 07-24-22 
1. Reviewed some youtube virtual environment videos and I was able to create the virtual enviroment of the project
2. Created gitignore folder using github python template
