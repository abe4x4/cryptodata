<h1>CRYPTODATA</>
  
</p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

I am a student blockchain developer, I am hoping to graduate next spring. My plan is to make this Code Louisville graduation project the first step towards a much bigger work in progress project of extensive analysis and prediction of the preformance of different cryptocurrencies. I chose to make the project include more than jupyter notebook file, each file is relatively small and covers one feature of the future comprehensive project

The project will include the following features hoping to meet or exeed the requirements of a passing graduation project:

<h4>1. LOADING DATA </h4>
Read 2 dataset with an API.
The first API is forex-python (https://pypi.org/project/forex-python/) where I get bitcoin data, the second API is yfinance API (https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
 
<h4>2. CLEANING DATA</h4> 
Cleaning data and perform a pandas merge

<h4>3. VISUALIZE / PRESENT DATA</h4>
Make 3 matplotlib, pandas and seaborn visualizations to display data

<h4>4. UTILIZE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</h4>
I used the following code to create and use a virutal environment: <br>

<i>#create environment named venv</i><br>
python -m venv venv<br>

<i>#activate environment</i><br>
venv\scripts\activate.bat<br>

<i>#install project packages and dependencies</i><br>

<i>#create a requirements.txt file</i><br>
pip freeze > requirements.txt<br>

<i>#deactivate environment each time after working on the project</i><br>
deactivate<br>

<h4> EXTRA POINTS </h4>
My code is written using jupyter lab format, I wrote as much comments as possible. I used markdown cells and added text formating.

<h4> FINAL COMMENTS </h4>
The project is simple but it is a work in progress and the first lego piece in a much bigger more advanced project that I am hoping to use the complete project as the graduation project of my blockchain developper bootcamp. <br>
I would like to thankmy mentors for their great effort they made to help us. I liked their new innovative methods they used to present the material. I am also grateful to every person in Code Louisville staff

<h4><b>MY IDEAS AND PLANS FOR FUTURE EXPANSIONS</b></h4><br>
<ol>
<li>Studying and adding trading technical analysis indicators so the project become a smart and reliable crypto trading helper tool</li>
<li>Adding automation features so the project can be used as a trading bot</li>
<li>Add machine learning capability so it can be used to test different trading strategies</li>
<li>The project will stay open to any future ideas, suggestions and upgrades </li>
</ol>
